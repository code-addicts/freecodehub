                Where The Problems Began
            </h1>
            <br><br>
            <h5>
                Throughout my limited formal education, I did not have the best relationship with the field of mathematics. And by extension, this impacted my relationship with a great deal of computer science (CS) and software engineering (SEng).
            </h5>
            <br><br>
            <h5>
                To be specific, it is not that I am bad at math, but I am poor at arithmetic and bad at remembering formulae.
            </h5>
            <br><br>
            <h5>
                I also found that the way in which mathematics, CS, and SEng are usually taught in schools does not tend to work for me either.
            </h5>
            <br><br>
            <h5>
                My own learning process to this day is largely driven by pragmatism (emphasis on practical over theoretical knowledge), curiosity about nature, and how this information can help me earn a living – three things I saw rarely emphasized in my western education.
            </h5>
            <br><br>
            <h5>
                Apart from my uneasy relationship with dry and boring presentations of things which are predominantly of a mathematical nature, I am a self-taught programmer.
            </h5>
            <br><br>
            <h5>
                To be clear, I took a single programming class at a community college (circa 2013), and the rest of my knowledge comes from self-directed studies. During my early years of that process, I also had to work various day jobs in order to pay the rent, which left me very little spare time and energy to learn my craft.
            </h5>
            <br><br>
            <h5>
                The end result was that I chose to spend most of my time building personal projects and learning topics specifically for those projects.
            </h5>
            <br><br>
            <h5>
                This led to me being really quite good at the skill of writing code, learning new technologies, and solving problems. However, if I did apply any concepts in CS and SEng to the code I was writing, it was largely by accident.
            </h5>
            <br><br>
            <h5>
                To summarize this introduction, I am trying to say that the biggest obstacle in my study of SEng was that I just was not very interested in learning it.
            </h5>
            <br><br>
            <h5>
                 did not know the sense of accomplishment you can get from making a small change to an algorithm which reduces its runtime to completion by a factor of tens or hundreds of times.
            </h5>
            <br><br>
            <h5>
                I did not know how important it was to pick a data structure based on the nature of the problem I was trying to solve, let alone how to make that decision.
            </h5>
            <br><br>
            <h5>
                And I had no idea how it was relevant to me slinging mobile apps for a living.
            </h5>
            <br><br>
            <h5>
                So just in case you are in the same boat, before we get to the technical details, I would like to attempt to answer some of those questions for you. To make things less boring, I will motivate this topic by sharing a true story about what changed my attitude towards this subject.

                Swimming With the Big Fish
            </h1>
            <br><br>
            <h5>
                Towards the end of 2019, I had taken a break from studying Android Development in order to take a deep dive into UNIX Operating Systems and C/C++ programming.
            </h5>
            <br><br>
            <h5>
                I felt very comfortable with the Android SDK, but many years of JVM programming had left me with a strong sense of having no idea how computers actually worked under the hood. Which bothered me quite a bit.
            </h5>
            <br><br>
            <h5>
                I was not really looking for work, but at the time a recruiter from a big tech company had reached out to me about my interest in an Android Software Engineer position.
            </h5>
            <br><br>
            <h5>
                Despite being many months out of practice with Android, I did well in the first interview (it was all core Android concepts that I was familiar with) and was sent an email detailing the topics to be covered in future interviews.
            </h5>
            <br><br>
            <h5>
                The first section of this email, which detailed Android specific knowledge, was extensive, but I was at least somewhat familiar which most topics and not intimidated. However, when I scrolled down to the section on Data Structures and Algorithms, I suddenly felt like I did when I first started writing code: Like a fish out of water.
            </h5>
            <br><br>
            <h5>
                It is not that I had never applied any of these concepts in my code, but I certainly had not formally studied any of them.
            </h5>
            <br><br>
            <h5>
                Although I will do my best to give you a soft and clear introduction to these topics, SEng will immediately hit you with a wall of jargon terms, and my face was figuratively very sore and bruised after reading the entire list of DS and Algos I had to learn in that email.
            </h5>
            <br><br>
            <h5>
                I was very up front about that with my recruiter, who kindly gave me four weeks to prepare before the next interview.
            </h5>
            <br><br>
            <h5>
                I knew I could not cover every topic in four weeks, but I did hope that learning a year or two of SEng in a few weeks would show some talent and initiative.
            </h5>
            <br><br>
            <h5>
                I would love to tell you a juicy story about how I epically failed, or completely dazzled in the next interview, but the reality is that things fell apart before I even got the chance.
            </h5>
            <br><br>
            <h5>
                I am a Canadian citizen, and the position required relocation to one of many campuses in the United States, in either California or Washington State.
            </h5>
            <br><br>
            <h5>
                Two weeks into my first deep dive into SEng, I received an email from my recruiter stating that their immigration department did not want to sponsor me. I suspect it had to do with some difficulties around sponsoring a worker who had no degree, but the brewing global pandemic may also have been a factor.
            </h5>
            <br><br>
            <h5>
                In the end, even though I wanted the chance to succeed or fail in real time, I was happy knowing that I had a very clear idea of the knowledge I was lacking to be a software engineer in a big tech company.
            </h5>
            <br><br>
            <h5>
                With a clear but difficult path in front of me, I resolved to no longer let the field of SEng intimidate me. I wanted to know what it truly means to be a software developer versus a software engineer.
            </h5>
            <br><br>
            <h5>
                With that in mind, we shall go into the core ideas in SEng, and how to make the learning of them easier. Not easy – just easier.

                The "Big Three" Topics in Software Engineering –And Why They Matter:
            </h1>
            <br><br>
            <h5>
                The main topics in software engineering can be summarized using a bunch of big scary words and phrases – as is the tradition in anything related to computer science and mathematics. To avoid confusion, I will instead explain them using the English language and examples which prioritize clarity above all else.
            </h5>
            <br><br>
            <h5>
                I suggest you follow this section in the order I have laid out, as I have deliberately structured it in a logical progression.
            </h5>
            <br><br>
            <h2>
                First - What Are Runtime And Memory Space?
            </h2>
            <br><br>
            <h5>
                I want to start off by explaining the reason why we study these topics to begin with.
            </h5>
            <br><br>
            <h5>
                Being a fan of physics, I was happy to learn that the interplay of time and space which we see in nature is also directly observed in any kind of computer.
            </h5>
            <br><br>
            <h5>
                However, in this field, we refer to these qualities as <b>runtime</b> and <b>memory space</b>.
            </h5>
            <br><br>
            <h5>
                To better understand what runtime is, I suggest you pull up your Task Manager, Activity Monitor, or whatever program you have that tells you about your system’s active “processes.”
            </h5>
            <br><br>
            <h5>
                A process is just a “running program,” and through the magic of having multiple “processors”, CPU virtualization, and time slicing, it can appear that we have tens or hundreds of processes running at the same time.
            </h5>
            <br><br>
            <h5>
                I threw those jargon terms in so that you can look them up if you are curious about how operating systems work, but <b>doing so it is not necessary to proceed with this article</b>.
            </h5>
            <br><br>
            <h5>
                In any case, a process’s runtime can generally be thought of as any point in time during which it can be viewed in your system’s process tracking tool.
            </h5>
            <br><br>
            <h5>
                I use this definition to point out that an active process does not need to have a user interface or even do anything useful even though it may still be taking up runtime in the CPU and memory space.
            </h5>
            <br><br>
            <h5>
                Speaking of memory space, in order for something to have run time, it has to be somewhere too. That somewhere is the physical memory space of the computer, which is virtualized (again, look up virtualization on your own time but it is not necessary for this article) in order to make it more secure and easier to use.
            </h5>
            <br><br>
            <h5>
                Every process is allocated its own distinct and protected virtual memory space, which can grow or shrink up to certain boundaries and depending on various factors.
            </h5>
            <br><br>
            <h5>
                Let us take a break from theory to talk about why we should care about it. Since runtime and memory space can be accurately measured but are also limited, humans like you and I can really screw things up if we do not pay attention to these limitations!
            </h5>
            <br><br>
            <h5>
                To be clear, here are two very important things we want to care about as programmers and engineers:
            </h5>
            <br><br>
            <h5>
                <li>Will our program or even the whole system crash because we have mismanaged the finite resource of memory space?</li>
                <br>
                <li>Will our programs solve problems for our users in a timely and efficient manner, or will they hang so long that our users decide to force quit, demand a refund, and leave a nasty review?</li>
                <br>
            </h5>
            <br>
            <h5>
                These question largely dictate the success of our programs whether you formally study them or not. With any luck I have motivated you to learn what I call the big three topics in software engineering, which we shall go into now.
            </h5>
            <br><br>
            <h2>
                How We Measure Runtime And Memory Space:
            </h2>
            <br>
            <h5>The first of the big three topics is described using a big scary term:</h5>
            <br>
            <h5><b>Asymptotic Runtime & Space Complexity.</b></h5>
            <br><br>
            <h5>
                Having already described runtime and memory space, I think a serviceable replacement for the word complexity here is “efficiency." And asymptotic is related to the fact that we can represent this efficiency (or lack thereof) on a two dimensional Cartesian Graph. You know, x and y, rise over run, and all that stuff.
            </h5>
            <br><br>
            <h5>
                Do not worry if you are unfamiliar with this stuff. You only need a very basic understanding of these things to apply it in your code.
            </h5>
            <br><br>
            <h5>
                Also, note that there is such a thing as a Graph data structure, but that concept is far removed from a Cartesian Graph and not what I am referring to.
            </h5>
            <br><br>
            <h5>
                Since we can represent our code and how it behaves with respect to either runtime or memory space on a Cartesian Graph, it follows that there must be functions which describe how to draw such a graph.
            </h5>
            <br><br>
            <h5>
                The way in which we describe how efficient our code in this way is to use “Big O” notation.
            </h5>
            <br><br>
            <h5>
                Here is the simplest introduction I can give you in order to understand this topic. I will use the modern programming language Kotlin for my code samples which will hopefully provide a happy middle ground for you web and native developers.
            </h5>
            <br><br>
            <h5>
                Suppose three functions (also sometimes known as methods, algorithms, commands, or procedures):
            </h5>
            <br><br>
            <h5>
                Function <span class="bg-dark">printStatement</span>:
            </h5>
            <br>
            <img src="img/learn1.jpg" alt="" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
            <br><br><br>
            <h5>
                Function <span class="bg-dark">printArray</span>:
            </h5>
            <br>
            <img src="img/learn2.jpg" alt="" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
            <br><br><br>
            <h5>
                Function <span class="bg-dark">printArraySums</span>:
            </h5>
            <br>
            <img src="img/learn3.jpg" alt="" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
            <br><br><br>
            <h5>
                For ease of understanding, suppose that every time println(...) is called, it takes 100ms, or 1/10th of a second on average to complete (in reality 100ms for a single print command is terribly slow but it's easier to imagine than a microsecond or picosecond).
            </h5>
            <br><br>
            <h5>
                With that in mind, let us think critically about how these functions can be expected to behave differently, based on what inputs they are given.
            </h5>
            <br><br>
            <h5>
                <span class="bg-dark">printStatement</span>, barring anything other than a catastrophic failure of the system itself, will always take an average time of 100ms to complete.
            </h5>
            <br><br>
            <h5>
                In fact, while Big O notation is very concerned about the size of the arguments given to a function (that will make more sense shortly), this function does not even have any arguments to change its behaviour.
            </h5>
            <br><br>
            <h5>
                Therefore, we can say that the runtime complexity (time taken until completion), is constant, which can be represented by the following mathematical function and graph:
            </h5>
